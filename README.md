Flight Simulator focused on lightweight planes. Both flight engine and graphical user interface.

The project is right now divided in to separated entities, *gvsim-simengine* and *gvsim-gui*
##gvsim-simengine
This is the core of the simulation, providing the numerical calculations

##gvsim-gui
Is the graphical interface asociated with the simulation engine. It enables the user to interface with the engine and allows to modify the plane model or record the flight, among other thins.
